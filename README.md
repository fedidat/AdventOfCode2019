## AdventOfCode2019

These will be my solutions for AdventOfCode2019. I hope to learn a new language but will start with Jupyter notebooks. Wish me luck!

### Notes

- Day 2: Getting started with Rust. Interesting in a good way!
- Day 4: Trying out Scala. Not what I'm used to, even as a Java programmer.
- Day 10: I waste hours trying to get Typescript running, but it and others require so much boilerplate that I find Java lightweight... While I liked Rust's robustness, only Python is truly powerful so far. I can't wait to try a Lisp since it's very efficient at getting trivial stuff out of the way!
