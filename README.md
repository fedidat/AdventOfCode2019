## AdventOfCode2019

These will be my solutions for [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) 2019. I hope to learn a new language as usual but will start with Jupyter notebooks. Wish me luck!

### Notes

- Day 2: Getting started with Rust. Interesting in a good way!
- Day 4: Trying out Scala. Not what I'm used to, even as a Java programmer.
- Day 10: I wasted hours trying to get Typescript running, but it and others require so much boilerplate that I find Java lightweight... While I liked Rust's robustness, only Python is truly powerful so far. I can't wait to try a Lisp since it's very efficient at getting trivial stuff out of the way!
- Day 12: After wasting hours trying out Closure, which works strangely and is quite limited... back to Jupyter for now.
- Day 18: Can't beat Rust's performance! It's brilliant, though incomplete. A very good alternative to Java in my main toolbelt. Now I need a functional language to complete Python as scripting language and Rust as general-purpose. I'll keep trying to master Clojure or otherwise another Lisp.

### Closing notes

Having just finished Advent of Code 2019, here are my takeaways:
- I feel pretty good in Rust now. A very impressive language with a lot of potential. The fact that I did all IntCode is Rust easily despite its complexity shows its power for a safe and statically typed language.
- Python is unbeatable for quick prototyping. It's not even close.
- It's definitely hard to learn new paradigms with AOC, particularly when you have a full-time job (and then some). I failed to grasp Clojure and Scala but I'll keep working on that in my free time. I do need more functional programming in my toolbelt.

Thanks so much to Eric Wastl for the breathtaking creativity and accomplishment of putting all of this together, and to the [community](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for the friendship and support.
